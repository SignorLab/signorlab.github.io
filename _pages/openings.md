# JOIN US
I am seeking potential graduate students (masters and PhD) to join my lab at North Dakota State University. My lab studies evolutionary biology in Drosophila from a variety of perspectives including population genetics, quantitative genetics, and developmental biology.

We have two primary research areas: the defense against transposable elements and adaptation to environmental perturbations.
The defense against transposable elements is organized by piwi RNA in Drosophila, small RNAs cognate to transposable elements which coordinate their silencing through epigenetic mechanisms and RNA degradation. Individuals within a population differ considerably in their transposable element content and piwi RNA complement. The lab is interested in how much this varies, variation in transposable element suppression between individuals, and how selection on transposable element suppression shapes genome evolution. 

We also ask questions about how Drosophila adapts to heterogeneous environmental variables such as ethanol, how evolution to the environment proceeds at the gene regulatory level, and comparative evolution in response to environmental differences. In particular we are interested in the contribution of alternative splicing to adaptation and the evolution of plasticity.

There is also potential for collaboration on an existing project in the department on native bees.

Students with an interest in bioinformatics and/or experimental biology are welcome.

Admissions date is flexible. North Dakota State University is a land-grant institution located in Fargo, North Dakota. Fargo is a wonderful place to live, with a diverse food culture, an eclectic downtown, affordable housing, and good schools (if you have a family). If you are interested in this opportunity please send me an email at sarah.signor@ndsu.edu. Please let me know why you are interested in the lab, whether you are interested in a PhD or Masters, and attach a CV with at least two references. If you are a potential fit for the lab we can set up a Skype Interview
